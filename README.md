The other two Optimizations for the Costal Virginia and Revolution Wind farms were done by my partner Dat T. Trinh

The optimization was run by code initially developed by Prof Rafael Vallota Rodrigues and was eddited in various ways be run properly. For example,

    The wind terbine classes and the wind analysis data needed to be changed for each respective farm.

    Certain renaming of output files needed to be changed to be distiguisable from the rest of the data collected
